        I'm a clinical psychologist who is taking the leap into coding. For
        years, I’ve helped clients navigate challenges, guiding and advising but
        never able to directly fix the problems myself. Now, I’m ready to create
        my own solutions. Combining my background in psychology with a passion
        for mental health, I hope to build user-friendly apps that make a
        difference for Australians by being accessible, affordable and
        effective. Outside of work and coding, you’ll usually find me bouldering
        or playing the flute with my band — two hobbies that keep me balanced,
        creative, and always learning.

      <p>Join me as my worlds of psychology and technology collide.</p>
