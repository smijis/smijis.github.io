## Project Requirements

### Content

Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make?

- ✓ At least one profile picture
  I used object-fit to keep the image in proportion and a border-radius to give it a round border. I also used a container to make it responsive depending on viewport dimensions. This placed profile picture next to my header on the desktop, and the header goes underneath on mobile.
- ✓ Biography (at least 100 words)
  I wanted my bio to be centered with large padding on the sides for my desktop version. Therefore, I used text-align, added padding, and also max-width at 1000px so that it would not stretch on wider screens. I also made the font size 4vw, again to make it responsive and only 4% of the viewport width.
- ✓ Functional Contact Form
  I initially used the <form> tag; however, to center the form on the webpage, I ended up changing it to a container so I could adjust elements to my liking. I also put the contact form on a separate, third web page.
- ✓ "Projects" section
  I added a second webpage with just my projects. I needed to use a container and flexbox so I could put project one and two next to each other using, and then used flex-wrap to wrap projects 3 and 4 underneath.
- ✓ Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
  I used clickable icons that were linked to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages on the contact web page. As I wanted the icons to be next to the writing, I also used the footer as a container and applied flexbox.

### Technical

Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from?

- ✓ At least 2 web pages.
- ✓ Version controlled with Git
- ✓ Deployed on GitHub pages.
- ✓ Implements responsive design principles.
- ✓ Uses semantic HTML.
  I created 3 web pages, plus a 4th if you click one of the project image links (but it is not included in the navigation). I focused on responsive design principles, ensuring the layout adjusts well to different screen sizes, and used semantic HTML to give structure and meaning to the content. The project is version-controlled with Git and deployed on GitHub Pages, which allowed me to track changes efficiently and make it publicly accessible.

### Bonus (optional)

Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any.

- ✓ Different styles for active, hover and focus states. - I used hover for the project images which signified that they are clickable links. I also changed the colour of my navigation links and added a squiggle line underneath when one hovers over a link.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
